<h1 align='center'>Playing-With-Detection</h1>
In this project , we will try to channelize our curiosities of playing around with detection off faces using Computer Vision We aim to explore different face detection algorithms- Open CV Deep Face , VGGnet etc  and implement face detection on our dataset using the algorithm that best fits our idea. We then try to integrate an emotion detector mechanism over the faces that we detect.With this project we can detect face images even if the faces or pictures are in adverse environmental conditions(different camera angle, poor lighting, different facial expressions, facial accessories, etc.).
 

## Dataset

We have imported our dataset from kaggle. It is The Olivetti faces dataset. There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).The “target” for this database is an integer from 0 to 39 indicating the identity of the person pictured.
